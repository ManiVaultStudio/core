<h1>Automated error reporting</h1>
<p><b>ManiVault Studio</b> can automatically report bugs and crashes using <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a>. This might helps us fix issues faster and improve the application for everyone.</p>
<p>What we collect:
<ul>
    <li>Details about errors (e.g., crash logs, stack traces).</li>
    <li>Basic system information (e.g., operating system, app version).</li>
    <li>Contact details (if you opt to supply them)</li>
</ul>
<p>What we donâ€™t collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal files like projects or research data.</li>
    <li>Sensitive data like passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sentry has a privacy policy that outlines how they collect, use, and protect personal information. You can view the full policy <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/?">here</a>.</p> 

<p>You can opt out at any time in the application settings. </p>

<p>We also support <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted">self-hosted Sentry</a> servers. Simply  modify the error logging DSN in the application settings to point to your own self-hosted Sentry server to mitigate possible privacy concerns.</p>
