<h1>Learning center tutorials</h1>
<p>As part of the learning center, <b></b>ManiVault Studio</b> can optionally download dynamic tutorial content. When you enable this feature, the application connects to servers to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fetch available tutorials listings.</li>
        <li>Download tutorial projects.</li>
    </ul>
<p>You will find this feature at the start page of <b>ManiVault Studio</b> and in the help menu.</p>
<p>Tutorials listings and projects might originate from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Servers hosted by the ManiVault Studio team.</li>
    <li>Servers hosted by third-party plugin developers if the plugins provide tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Please note that we do not track which tutorials you download.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to allow automatic downloads of start page content, you can disable this feature at any time in the application settings.</p>
