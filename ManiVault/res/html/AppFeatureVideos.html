<h1>Learning center videos</h1>
<p>As part of the learning center, <b>ManiVault Studio</b> can optionally download dynamic video content. When you enable this feature, the application connects to servers to fetch available videos listings (the videos are watched by opening a browser window). Videos listings might originate from:
<ul>
    <li>Servers hosted by the ManiVault Studio team.</li>
    <li>Servers hosted by third-party plugin developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Please note that we do not track which videos you view.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to allow automatic downloads of videos content, you can disable this feature at any time in the application settings.</p>
