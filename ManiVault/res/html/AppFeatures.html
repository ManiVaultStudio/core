<h1>Automated error reporting and start page content</h1>

<p><b>ManiVault Studio</b> can automatically report bugs and crashes using <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a>. This might help us fix issues faster and improve the application for everyone.</p>

<p>What we collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Details about errors (e.g., crash logs, stack traces).</li>
    <li>Basic system information (e.g., operating system, app version).</li>
    <li>Contact details (if you opt to supply them).</li>
</ul>

<p>What we donâ€™t collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal files like projects or research data.</li>
    <li>Sensitive data like passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can opt out of automated error reporting at any time in the application settings.</p>

<h2>Start page content</h2>

<p><b>ManiVault Studio</b> can optionally download dynamic content for the application's start page. This content includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A curated list of tutorials, which can be downloaded and opened directly.</li>
    <li>A curated list of projects, which can be downloaded and opened directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you enable this feature, the application connects to ManiVault Studio servers to fetch available tutorials and project listings. We do not track which tutorials or projects you view or download.</p>

<p>If you prefer not to allow automatic downloads of start page content, you can disable this feature in the application settings.</p>
