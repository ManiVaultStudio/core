    <ul>
        <li>Fetch available projects listings.</li>
        <li>Download projects.</li>
    </ul>
<p>You will find this feature at the start page, and posibly during startup of <b>ManiVault Studio</b>.</p>
<p>Projects listings and projects might originate from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Servers hosted by the ManiVault Studio team.</li>
    <li>Servers hosted by third-party plugin developers (i.e. example projects accompanied by plugins).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we do not track which projects you download.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to allow automatic downloads of projects, you can disable this feature at any time in the application settings.</p>
